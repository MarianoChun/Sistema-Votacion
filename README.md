# Voting System-TP-P2
This project simulates the functioning of a Votation System, it's been thougth to do the administrative work related to an election in a polling place.
It was developed to be the final work for my college subject "Programming II".
## Usage
The system can be used from the "Cliente" class, calling the methods of the main class "SistemaDeTurnos" and using the voters data of the "Fixture" class. 
## Features
The votation system has the following main functionalities:
* Register voters
* Add new voting points (voting desks)
* Assign turns (Wether individually or to all voters)
* Inform if a voter is registered or not in the system
* Obtain the turn of a certain voter
* Inform the amount of voters with a turn
* Show the turns of all voters
* Show the amount of voters without a turn according to it's condition[^1]
* Inform if the voter already voted or not
[^1]: The assignment of turns vary depending on the condition of the voter (Worker, people older than 65 years old, etc)
## Project status
At this moment i don't have intentions of updating/mantaining the code. Despite this, i may come back to it in a future.
